    	      <h2>Soundism: Producers, Engineers, and Composers</h2>
              <p>Soundism&#8482; is a group of <a href="en/music-producers/index.htm" >music producers</a>, <a href="en/sound-engineers/vladi-vargas.htm">sound engineers</a>, and <a href="en/music-producers/index.htm" >songwriters</a>. The group has full access to dedicated <a href="en/music-recording-studios/index.htm" >music recording studios</a>. The musical journey includes several first-rate artists on the international music scene. The natural area of exploration for Soundism is music played by DJs and Selectors. We are primarily involved with Dancehall, Funk, Hip-hop, Jazz, Ragga, Reggae, RnB, Ska, and Soul projects. </p>
            
          <p>It's difficult to pinpoint exactly where Soundism started. A milestone event was the finals of the of Swedish Rap Championship in 1989, where Soundism producer <a href="en/sound-engineers/vladi-vargas.htm">Vladi Vargas</a>' track was performed, perhaps the earliest <a href="en/services/music-production.htm">music production</a>. At that time, tunes were produced with the simplest means routed in DJ style, yet the <a href="en/services/hip-hop-beat-makers.htm">beats</a> were already for real. A groove has always been crucial on the roads that Soundism has taken. The beats are essential, regardless if people call it Hip-Hop, Reggae, or something else.</p>
            
            <p>Finding that final tweak on the tune in the  <a href="en/services/mixing.htm">mixing</a> is probably one of Soundism's most reliable strengths. Soundism has continuously changed and is endlessly moving on, riding the flow its own way. See &quot;<a href="en/discography/index.htm">Discography</a>&quot; for a list of artists, projects, and recordings our music journey has included so far.</p>
